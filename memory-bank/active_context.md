# Active Context

## Current Phase: Initialization (Başlangıç Aşaması)
We are currently setting up the project foundation. The user has manually prepared the environment.

## Current Tasks (Şu Anki Durum)
1.  **[COMPLETED]** Memory Bank system created manually (`project_brief.md`, `tech_context.md`, `active_context.md`).
2.  **[COMPLETED]** Project assets (images) placed manually in `/public/gorseller/` (google-yorumlar, novastra, profil).
3.  **[PENDING]** Initialize React + Vite project structure.
4.  **[PENDING]** Install dependencies (framer-motion, lenis, tailwind).
5.  **[PENDING]** Create `src/data/projects.js` to link manual assets to code.

## Next Step (Sıradaki Adım)
-   Execute the scaffolding prompt to install React and set up the file structure based on the Memory Bank rules.
